# 🧭 Linux File Explorer (C++)

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

The **Linux File Explorer** is a console-based application developed in **C++** that interacts directly with the **Linux operating system** to perform essential file and directory management operations.  
It replicates the basic functionality of a file manager but in a **command-line interface (CLI)** — offering an efficient and lightweight way to manage files using simple commands.  

This project demonstrates:
- The use of **C++17 filesystem libraries**
- **Object-oriented programming principles**
- **Linux file permission management**

It showcases both **system-level programming** and **structured logic design**.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a **command-line file explorer** that allows users to:

- 🗂️ View directory contents  
- 📁 Navigate through directories  
- 🧩 Create, delete, copy, and move files or folders  
- 🔍 Search for files within the system  
- 🔒 Manage file permissions  

This project helps in understanding how **C++ interacts with the Linux filesystem** and provides **hands-on experience** with low-level file operations and permission handling.
