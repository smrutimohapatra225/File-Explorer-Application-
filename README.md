# 🧭 Linux File Explorer (C++)

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

The **Linux File Explorer** is a console-based application developed in **C++** that interacts directly with the **Linux operating system** to perform essential file and directory management operations.  
It replicates the basic functionality of a file manager but in a **command-line interface (CLI)** — offering an efficient and lightweight way to manage files using simple commands.  

This project demonstrates:
- The use of **C++17 filesystem libraries**
- **Object-oriented programming principles**
- **Linux file permission management**

It showcases both **system-level programming** and **structured logic design**.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a **command-line file explorer** that allows users to:

- 🗂️ View directory contents  
- 📁 Navigate through directories  
- 🧩 Create, delete, copy, and move files or folders  
- 🔍 Search for files within the system  
- 🔒 Manage file permissions  

This project helps in understanding how **C++ interacts with the Linux filesystem** and provides **hands-on experience** with low-level file operations and permission handling.

## 🗓️ Day-wise Implementation

| Day | Task | Description |
|-----|------|--------------|
| **Day 1** | 📂 List Files | Designed the structure and implemented directory listing |
| **Day 2** | 🧭 Navigation | Added directory traversal commands such as `cd` and `ls` |
| **Day 3** | ⚙️ File Manipulation | Enabled file operations like `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, and `touch` |
| **Day 4** | 🔍 Search | Implemented recursive search functionality using file iteration |
| **Day 5** | 🔒 Permissions | Integrated permission view and modification features (`viewperm`, `chmod`) |

---

## ⚙️ Features Implemented

✅ List all files and folders within a directory  
✅ Navigate through directories easily  
✅ Copy, move, rename, delete, and create files/folders  
✅ Recursively search files by name  
✅ View and modify file permissions  
✅ User-friendly CLI interface with error handling

## 💻 Commands Used

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ls` | List directory contents |
| `cd <dir>` | Change current directory |
| `cp <src> <dest>` | Copy a file |
| `mv <src> <dest>` | Move or rename a file |
| `rm <file>` | Delete a file |
| `mkdir <folder>` | Create a directory |
| `touch <file>` | Create an empty file |
| `search <filename>` | Search for a file recursively |
| `viewperm <file>` | View file permissions |
| `chmod <octal> <file>` | Change file permissions (e.g., `chmod 755 file`) |
| `exit` | Exit the explorer |
